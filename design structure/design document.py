# BESTFriend


#To start my idea of this design, I took the idea of a game from youtube called "existor".

#This is a similator game all about talking to your bestfriend. The computer have its own experience and know how to cheer up the user.

#So, I wrote down what the Computer says and the users responses. It is alot of thinking to do, so I could type down a mix of respectful, and funny response.

#To Start off it will be, "COMPUTER: how are you today?" [Response choice: "ok", "good", "bad"].

#Then with those responses the COMPUTER will lead into those three responses, and conversations will happen. Keep in mind this is only a demo verison of the game.

#I haven't yet find different method to make the coversations last for awhile until the user decides to quit the game.

#I provided simple method such as "if" and "elif" statement along with the "input" code. I somehow created the program without using define or any method to make it easier.

#Most of these method are in the book of chapter 1 and 2 to create this project.

#As the user progress through the game, The computer will give you tips and sayings to cheer up the user,the computer will get to give you a easter egg hidden in the program if you done the responses correctly.

#Copy and paste to python and run it

#Enjoy!
